 * @section devel_effective Effective Development
 * Over time, some workarounds regarding effective development of KerMor and applications have emerged.
 *
 * @subsection devel_autopath Automatic PATH inclusion on startup
 * If you are using KerMor and changing classes of KerMor at the same time, you will
 * find yourself changing the working directory quite often.
 * KerMor features an automatic PATH inclusion upon KerMor.start according to the following scheme:
 * - Any folder within the KerMor.HomeDirectory named "z*" will be automatically added to the \c matlabpath
 * - Any folder within the KerMor.HomeDirectory named "zz*" will be ignored (as all others)
 *
 * This way, a symlink named "zMyKerMorPoweredProject" (for example) will be
 * added to the path, allowing to work on both KerMor source files and
 * project source files from one MatLab directory.
 *
 * @section codingguidelines Coding guidlines
 * Here you can find some information about how to write new code 
 * for the KerMor framework.
 *
 * @subsection create_files Creating new classes and functions 
 * An extra class Devel has been created to aid @ref developers creating new files in the manner of KerMor.
 *
 * This class has two static methods Devel.newClass and Devel.newFun which can be used to create the 
 * respective files in the current folder. When calling those functions, either the files template_class and template_fun
 * from the KerMor root directory are parsed and their output is used as new file. This allows to automatically create 
 * class/function skeletons matching the current developer and KerMor version.
 *
 * Please make sure you use the Devel class in order to keep the line of KerMor development.
 *
 * @subsection getter_setter Getter & Setter
 * Writing getter & setter methods for your classes can usually be done straightforwardly.
 * As setters allow to check for a required type of a property, custom methods and
 * actions may be required to validate the value to be set. However, extreme care
 * must be taken when implementing custom setters as the save/load cycle managed
 * by matlab does not check or guarantee any order in which the properties are loaded.
 * As the setter is invoked for every property customized code may fail to work
 * or validate wrong when other properties (even in remote classes!) may not yet
 * have been set. In order to avoid this, MatLab offers the Dependent 
 * (http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/matlab_oop/f2-74190.html#f2-85430) keyword
 * in order to avoid problems during loading.
 * A detailed example on how to utilize this property attribute is given at
 * http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/matlab_oop/brzypp0.html#brzy2f2, for example.
 *
 * An example within the KerMor framework is the property models.ReducedModel.ErrorEstimator.
 * Setting this property calls a validation method if this error estimator is
 * applicable to the given model, and thus accesses many remote object's properties.
 * Upon load, this must not be executed as some values aren't loaded yet. So declaring
 * this property as Dependent avoids this value to be set by the builtin load
 * method. 
 *  
 * @par Further examples:
 * - dscomponents.AKernelCoreFun
 * - models.BaseModel

/**
@page docpage Documentation creation
@short Guidlines for creating and maintaining this documentation
 
Please refer to the @subpage docupdate "Required documentation updates site"
 to see where the current documentation is outdated or not yet written.

@section dp_user User instructions
Once the application is installed  you can create the KerMor documentation by calling KerMor.createDocs. See the functions documentation for a list of optional parameters.

@section dp_devel Developer information: Complete file list of documentation creation related files
This section contains information for KerMor developers. The matlab-script KerMor.createDocs basically calls the 
script \c make.sh within the \c /documentation folder. Optionally, a parameter \c uml can be passed and
@verbatim ./make.sh uml @endverbatim generates graphical class visualizations that are UML-Style. This feature actually corresponds to the 
setting \c UMLSWITCH i.e. \c UML_LOOK in the Doxyfile.m4.

The following list of files gives a short overview about their individual role:
@li \c make.sh - Main documentation creation script.
@li \c Commands.tex - Place any custom commands you want to use within your in-code latex environment inside this file.
@li \c development.c - Documentation for active developers
@li \c DocumentationGuide - This is an example class showing how to document matlab classes in order to have them displayed most sensibly using doxygen.
@li \c Doxyfile.m4 - The configuration file for doxygen. Is parsed using the m4 preprocessor to insert correct paths.
@li \c doxygen_todo.m - A matlab file containing some tasks yet to investigate regarding the doxygen documentation creation.
@li \c groups.c - Documentation of Modules
@li \c handle_substitute.c - A C file that contains a fake handle class description as the native matlab handle class is not found/parsed by doxygen.
@li \c kermor.jpg - The logo of KerMor
@li \c kermorlatex.m4 - The style file included into the _formulas.tex file when latex is run. Add any additional package declarations here (or in Commands.tex)
Will be processed by m4 for correct path substitution.
@li \c mainpage.c - The main page source documentation file
@li \c relatedpages.c - The source file for all related pages with short content
@li \c changelogs.c - The manual source files for the changelog pages
@li \c mtoc - M to C preprocessing binary (Thanks to M. Drohmann, Univ. of Mï¿½nster!)
@li \c mtoc.conf - M to C configuration file mtoc.conf
@li \c packages.c - The package documentation C file
@li \c postprocess - Binary for postprocessing any generated html files (removes matlabtypesubstitute etc)
For more details on some files see the following paragraphs.

@par Groups documentation groups.c

@par M to C configuration file mtoc.conf
