  abstract = {A Krylov subspace based projection method is presented for model reduction
	of large scale bilinear systems. A reduced bilinear system is constructed
	in such a way that it matches a desired number of moments of multivariable
	transfer functions corresponding to the kernels of Volterra series
	representation of the original system. Applications to the simulation
	of dynamical responses of a nonlinear circuit and a micromachined
	device are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the new method
	and compare with an approach recently proposed by Phillips.},

  year = {2005},
  volume = {21},
  pages = {275 - 293},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {We study nonlinear m-term approximation with regard to a redundant
	dictionary D in a Banach space. It is known that in the case of Hilbert
	space H the pure greedy algorithm (or, more generally, the weak greedy
	algorithm) provides for each f â H and any dictionary D an expansion
	into a series f = â j = 1 â c j ( f ) Ï j ( f ) , Ï j ( f )
	â D , j = 1 , 2 , â¦ with the Parseval property: â¥ f â¥ 2 =
	â j | c j ( f ) | 2 . The orthogonal greedy algorithm (or, more
	generally, the weak orthogonal greedy algorithm) has been introduced
	in order to enhance the rate of convergence of greedy algorithms.
	Recently, we have studied analogues of the PGA and WGA for a given
	finite number of functions f 1 , â¦ , f N with a requirement that
	the dictionary elements Ï j of these expansions are the same for
	all f i , i = 1 , â¦ , N . We have studied convergence and rate
	of convergence of such expansions which we call simultaneous expansions.
	The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we work in a Hilbert space
	and enhance the convergence of the simultaneous greedy algorithms
	by introducing an analogue of the orthogonalization process, and
	we give estimates on the rate of convergence. Then, we study simultaneous
	greedy approximation in a more general setting, namely, in uniformly
	smooth Banach spaces.},

	bases of kernel translates are badly conditioned while the interpolation
	itself is not unstable in function space, this paper surveys the
	choices of other bases. All data-dependent bases turn out to be defined
	via a factorization of the kernel matrix defined by these data, and
	a discussion of various matrix factorizations (e.g. Cholesky, QR,
	SVD) provides a variety of different bases with different properties.
	Special attention is given to duality, stability, orthogonality,
	adaptivity, and computational efficiency. The âNewtonâ basis
	arising from a pivoted Cholesky factorization turns out to be stable
	and computationally cheap while being orthonormal in the ânativeâ
	Hilbert space of the kernel. Efficient adaptive algorithms for calculating
	the Newton basis along the lines of orthogonal matching pursuit conclude

  abstract = { In this paper, we present an approach to nonlinear model reduction
	based on representing a nonlinear system with a piecewise-linear
	system and then reducing each of the pieces with a Krylov projection.
	However, rather than approximating the individual components as piecewise
	linear and then composing hundreds of components to make a system
	with exponentially many different linear regions, we instead generate
	a small set of linearizations about the state trajectory which is
	the response to a "training input." Computational results and performance
	data are presented for an example of a micromachined switch and selected
	nonlinear circuits. These examples demonstrate that the macromodels
	obtained with the proposed reduction algorithm are significantly
	more accurate than models obtained with linear or recently developed
	quadratic reduction techniques. Also, we propose a procedure for
	a posteriori estimation of the simulation error, which may be used
	to determine the accuracy of the extracted trajectory piecewise-linear
	reduced-order models. Finally, it is shown that the proposed model
	order reduction technique is computationally inexpensive, and that
	the models can be constructed "on the fly," to accelerate simulation
	of the system response.},

  journal = {J. Comp. Appl. Math.},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {212},
  pages = {127 - 149},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Interpolation problems for analytic radial basis functions like the
	Gaussian and inverse multiquadrics can degenerate in two ways: the
	radial basis functions can be scaled to become increasingly flat,
	or the data points coalesce in the limit while the radial basis functions
	stay fixed. Both cases call for a careful regularization, which,
	if carried out explicitly, yields a preconditioning technique for
	the degenerating linear systems behind these interpolation problems.
	This paper deals with both cases. For the increasingly flat limit,
	we recover results by Larsson and Fornberg together with Lee, Yoon,
	and Yoon concerning convergence of interpolants towards polynomials.
	With slight modifications, the same technique can also handle scenarios
	with coalescing data points for fixed radial basis functions. The
	results show that the degenerating local Lagrange interpolation problems
	converge towards certain HermiteâBirkhoff problems. This is an
	important prerequisite for dealing with approximation by radial basis
	functions adaptively, using freely varying data sites.},

  year = {2008},
  volume = {17},
  pages = {235-409},
  abstract = {In this survey we discuss properties of specific methods of approximation
	that belong to a family of greedy approximation methods (greedy algorithms).
	It is now well understood that we need to study nonlinear sparse
	representations in order to significantly increase our ability to
	process (compress, denoise, etc.) large data sets. Sparse representations
	of a function are not only a powerful analytic tool but they are
	utilized in many application areas such as image/signal processing
	and numerical computation. The key to finding sparse representations
	is the concept of m-term approximation of the target function by
	the elements of a given system of functions (dictionary). The fundamental
	question is how to construct good methods (algorithms) of approximation.
	Recent results have established that greedy-type algorithms are suitable
	methods of nonlinear approximation in both m-term approximation with
	regard to bases, and m-term approximation with regard to redundant
	systems. It turns out that there is one fundamental principle that
	allows us to build good algorithms, both for arbitrary redundant
	systems and for very simple well-structured bases, such as the Haar
	basis. This principle is the use of a greedy step in searching for
	a new element to be added to a given m-term approximant.},
