  abstract = {A rigorous method for interpolating a set of parameterized linear
	structural dynamics reduced-order models (ROMs) is presented. By
	design, this method does not operate on the underlying set of parameterized
	full-order models. Hence, it is amenable to an online real-time implementation.
	It is based on mapping appropriately the ROM data onto a tangent
	space to the manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices, interpolating
	the mapped data in this space and mapping back the result to the
	aforementioned manifold. Algorithms for computing the forward and
	backward mappings are offered for the case where the ROMs are derived
	from a general Galerkin projection method and the case where they
	are constructed from modal reduction. The proposed interpolation
	method is illustrated with applications ranging from the fast dynamic
	characterization of a parameterized structural model to the fast
	evaluation of its response to a given input. In all cases, good accuracy
	is demonstrated at real-time processing speeds. Copyright Â© 2009

	across multiple tasks. This method is a generalization of the well-known

	1-norm regularization. It is based on a novel non-convex regularizer
	which
	
	controls the number of learned features common across the tasks. We
	prove
	
	that the method is equivalent to solving a convex optimization problem
	for
	
	which there is an iterative algorithm which converges to an optimal
	solution.
	
	The algorithm has a simple interpretation: it alternately performs
	a supervised
	
	and an unsupervised step, where in the former step it learns task-speci¯c
	
	functions and in the latter step it learns common-across-tasks sparse
	representations

	which learns sparse nonlinear representations using kernels. We report
	experiments
	
	on simulated and real data sets which demonstrate that the proposed
	
	method can both improve the performance relative to learning each
	task independently
	
	and lead to a few learned features common across related tasks.

	- a few common variables across the tasks},

  title = {Convergence Rates for Greedy Algorithms in Reduced Basis Methods},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {The reduced basis method was introduced for the accurate online evaluation
	of
	
	solutions to a parameter dependent family of elliptic partial di?erential
	equations.
	
	Abstractly, it can be viewed as determining a ?good? n dimensional
	space Hn to be
	
	used in approximating the elements of a compact set F in a Hilbert
	space H. One, by
	
	now popular, computational approach is to ?nd Hn through a greedy
	strategy. It is
	
	natural to compare the approximation performance of the Hn generated
	by this strategy
	
	with that of the Kolmogorov widths dn (F) since the latter gives the
	smallest error that
	
	can be achieved by subspaces of ?xed dimension n. The ?rst such comparisons,
	given in
	
	[1], show that the approximation error, ?n (F) := dist(F, Hn ), obtained
	by the greedy
	
	strategy satis?es ?n (F) ? Cn2n dn (F). In this paper, various improvements
	of this
	
	result will be given. Among these, it is shown that whenever dn (F)
	? M n?? , for all
	
	n > 0, and some M, ? > 0, we also have ?n (F) ? C? M n?? for all n
	> 0, where
	
	C? depends only on ?. Similar results are derived for generalized
	exponential rates of
	
	 ?
	
	the form M e?an . The exact greedy algorithm is not always computationally
	feasible
	
	and a commonly used computationally friendly variant can be formulated
	as a ?weak
	
	greedy algorithm?. The results of this paper are established for this
	version as well.},

  abstract = {The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method as a systematic technique
	to analyze parameter-dependent problems may be inappropriate as a
	practical tool for generating low-dimensional models. We propose
	a weighted POD (w-POD) as an alternative to give higher priority
	to low-energetic or important modes by simply weighting. A predefined
	POD (p-POD) is suggested, where modes are selected not only on the
	basis of energy but also on some a priori knowledge of the system.
	The techniques are tested on a flow problem undergoing steady or
	unsteady transition but may in general be applied to nonlinear systems
	of discretized PDEs closed by additional linear algebraic equations.
	Various residual functions to measure the quality of the reduced
	models are introduced. They provide lower limits of residual energy
	to ensure an adequate physical representation for a given modeling.
	It is shown that modes extracted locally may generally not contain
	information regarding the global dynamics, and the dynamics may not
	be correctly predicted over a longer range of model parameters. It
	is demonstrated that by weighting and predefining base vectors it
	is possible to improve the POD technique's capability to generate
	low-dimensional models.},

  abstract = {In flexible multibody dynamics, advanced modelling methods lead to
	high-order non-linear differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). The
	development of model reduction techniques is motivated by control
	design problems, for which compact ordinary differential equations
	(ODEs) in closed-form are desirable. In a linear framework, reduction
	techniques classically rely on a projection of the dynamics onto
	a linear subspace. In flexible multibody dynamics, we propose to
	project the dynamics onto a submanifold of the configuration space,
	which allows to eliminate the non-linear holonomic constraints and
	to preserve the Lagrangian structure. The construction of this submanifold
	follows from the definition of a global modal parameterization (GMP):
	the motion of the assembled mechanism is described in terms of rigid
	and flexible modes, which are configuration-dependent. The numerical
	reduction procedure is presented, and an approximation strategy is
	also implemented in order to build a closed-form expression of the
	reduced model in the configuration space. Numerical and experimental
	results illustrate the relevance of this approach. Copyright Â© 2006

  abstract = {A dimension reduction method called discrete empirical interpolation
	is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity
	of the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing
	reduced-order models for unsteady and/or parametrized nonlinear partial
	differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity,
	the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense
	that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating
	the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. Empirical
	interpolation posed in finite dimensional function space is a modification
	of POD that reduces complexity of the nonlinear term of the reduced
	model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained
	by POD. We propose a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM),
	a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems
	of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented
	here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization
	of unsteady time dependent PDE and/or parametrically dependent steady
	state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems
	of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a
	greatly simplified description of EIM in a finite dimensional setting
	that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An
	application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the
	1-D FitzHugh-Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from
	1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time
	integration that fully captured non-linear limit cycle behavior.
	We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with
	similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results.},

  abstract = {The radial basis function network offers a viable alternative to the
	two-layer neural network in many applications of signal processing.
	A common learning algorithm for radial basis function networks is
	based on first choosing randomly some data points as radial basis
	function centers and then using singular-value decomposition to solve
	for the weights of the network. Such a procedure has several drawbacks,
	and, in particular, an arbitrary selection of centers is clearly
	unsatisfactory. The authors propose an alternative learning procedure
	based on the orthogonal least-squares method. The procedure chooses
	radial basis function centers one by one in a rational way until
	an adequate network has been constructed. In the algorithm, each
	selected center maximizes the increment to the explained variance
	or energy of the desired output and does not suffer numerical ill-conditioning
	problems. The orthogonal least-squares learning strategy provides
	a simple and efficient means for fitting radial basis function networks.
	This is illustrated using examples taken from two different signal
	processing applications},

  abstract = {Apoptosis is an important physiological process which enables organisms
	to remove unwanted or damaged cells. A mathematical model of the
	extrinsic pro-apoptotic signaling pathway has been introduced by
	Eissing et al. (2007) and a bistable behavior with a stable death
	state and a stable life state of the reaction system has been established.
	
	
	In this paper, we consider a spatial extension of the extrinsic pro-apoptotic
	signaling pathway incorporating diffusion terms and make amodel-based,
	numerical analysis of the apoptotic switch in the spatial dimension.
	For the parameter regimes under consideration it turns out that for
	this model diffusion homogenizes rapidly the concentrations which
	afterward are governed by the original reaction system. The activation
	of effector-caspase 3 depends on the space averaged initial concentration
	of pro-caspase 8 and pro-caspase 3 at the beginning of the process.},

  abstract = {The problem of optimally approximating a function with a linear expansion
	over a redundant dictionary of waveforms is NP-hard. The greedy matching
	pursuit algorithm and its orthogonalized variant produce suboptimal
	function expansions by iteratively choosing dictionary waveforms
	that best match the functionâs structures. A matching pursuit provides
	a means of quickly computing compact, adaptive function approximations.
	Numerical experiments show that the approximation errors from matching
	pursuits initially decrease rapidly, but the asymptotic decay rate
	of the errors is slow. We explain this behavior by showing that matching
	pursuits are chaotic, ergodic maps. The statistical properties of
	the approximation errors of a pursuit can be obtained from the invariant
	measure of the pursuit. We characterize these measures using group
	symmetries of dictionaries and by constructing a stochastic differential
	equation model. We derive a notion of the coherence of a signal with
	respect to a dictionary from our characterization of the approximation
	errors of a pursuit. The dictionary elements slected during the initial
	iterations of a pursuit correspond to a functionâs coherent structures.
	The tail of the expansion, on the other hand, corresponds to a noise
	which is characterized by the invariant measure of the pursuit map.
	When using a suitable dictionary, the expansion of a function into
	its coherent structures yields a compact approximation. We demonstrate
	a denoising algorithm based on coherent function expansions.},

	that part of the subject which is important in numerical computation.
	Nonlinear approximation means that the approximants do not come from
	linear spaces but rather from nonlinear manifolds. The central question
	to be studied is what, if any, are the advantages of nonlinear approximation
	over the simpler, more established, linear methods. This question
	is answered by studying the rate of approximation which is the decrease
	in error versus the number of parameters in the approximant. The
	number of parameters usually correlates well with computational effort.
	It is shown that in many settings the rate of nonlinear approximation
	can be characterized by certain smoothness conditions which are significantly
	weaker than required in the linear theory. Emphasis in the survey
	will be placed on approximation by piecewise polynomials and wavelets
	as well as their numerical implementation. Results on highly nonlinear
	methods such as optimal basis selection and greedy algorithms (adaptive
	pursuit) are also given. Applications to image processing, statistical
	estimation, regularity for PDEs, and adaptive algorithms are discussed.

  abstract = {{{[}1] Gravity-driven fingers in uniform porous medium are known to
	have a distinctive nonmonotonic saturation profile, with saturated
	( or nearly so) tips and much less saturation in the tails. In this

	smaller than the finger diameter, thus essentially one-dimensional)
	are found to produce saturation overshoot identical to that found
	in gravity-driven fingers. Light transmission is used to measure
	the saturation profiles as a function of infiltrating flux, porous
	media grain size, grain sphericity, and initial water saturation.
	Saturation overshoot is found to cease below a certain minimum infiltrating
	flux. This minimum flux depends greatly on the grain sphericity and
	initial water content of the media and slightly on the mean grain
	size. The observed saturation overshoot is inconsistent with a continuum
	description of porous media but qualitatively matches well observations

  abstract = {We describe a method for recovering the underlying parametrization

	derives from a conceptual framework of local isometry in which the
	manifold M, viewed as a Riemannian submanifold of the ambient Euclidean
	space ân, is locally isometric to an open, connected subset Î
	of Euclidean space âd. Because Î does not have to be convex, this
	framework is able to handle a significantly wider class of situations
	than the original ISOMAP algorithm. The theoretical framework revolves
	around a quadratic form â(f) = â«Mââ¥Hf(m)â¥dm defined on
	functions f : M â¦ â. Here Hf denotes the Hessian of f, and â(f)
	averages the Frobenius norm of the Hessian over M. To define the
	Hessian, we use orthogonal coordinates on the tangent planes of M.
	The key observation is that, if M truly is locally isometric to an
	open, connected subset of âd, then â(f) has a (d + 1)-dimensional
	null space consisting of the constant functions and a d-dimensional
	space of functions spanned by the original isometric coordinates.
	Hence, the isometric coordinates can be recovered up to a linear
	isometry. Our method may be viewed as a modification of locally linear
	embedding and our theoretical framework as a modification of the
	Laplacian eigenmaps framework, where we substitute a quadratic form
	based on the Hessian in place of one based on the Laplacian.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach to treating nonlinear operators in reduced
	basis approximations of parametrized evolution equations. Our approach
	is based on empirical interpolation of nonlinear differential operators
	and their Fréchet derivatives. Efficient offline/online decomposition
	is obtained for discrete operators that allow an efficient evaluation
	for a certain set of interpolation functionals. An a posteriori error
	estimate for the resulting reduced basis method is derived and analyzed
	numerically. We introduce a new algorithm, the PODEI-greedy algorithm,
	which constructs the reduced basis spaces for the empirical interpolation
	and for the numerical scheme in a synchronized way. The approach
	is applied to nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic equations based
	on explicit or implicit finite volume discretizations. We show that
	the resulting reduced scheme is able to capture the evolution of
	both smooth and discontinuous solutions. In case of symmetries of
	the problem, the approach realizes an automatic and intuitive space-compression
	or even space-dimensionality reduction. We perform empirical investigations
	of the error convergence and run-times. In all cases we obtain a
	good run-time acceleration.},

	coupling between the macroscopic and microscopic models. In cases

	the microscopic solver is used to supply the necessary data for the
	microscopic solver. Besides unifying several existing multiscale
	methods such as the ab initio molecular dynamics [13], quasicontinuum
	methods [73,69,68] and projective methods for systems with multiscales
	[34,35], HMM also provides a methodology for designing new methods
	for a large variety of multiscale problems. A framework is presented
	for the analysis of the stability and accuracy of HMM. Applications
	to problems such as homogenization, molecular dynamics, kinetic models
	and interfacial dynamics are discussed.},

  abstract = {Finite element models for hydrated soft biological tissue are numerous
	but often exhibit certain essential deficiencies concerning the reproduction
	of relevant mechanical and electro-chemical responses. As a matter
	of fact, singlephasic models can never predict the interstitial fluid
	flow or related effects like osmosis. Quite a few models have more
	than one constituent, but are often restricted to the small-strain
	domain, are not capable of capturing the intrinsic viscoelasticity
	of the solid skeleton, or do not account for a collagen fibre reinforcement.
	It is the goal of this contribution to overcome these drawbacks and
	to present a thermodynamically consistent model, which is formulated
	in a very general way in order to reproduce the behaviour of almost
	any charged hydrated tissue. Herein, the Theory of Porous Media (TPM)
	is applied in combination with polyconvex Ogden -type material laws
	describing the anisotropic and intrinsically viscoelastic behaviour
	of the solid matrix on the basis of a generalised Maxwell model.
	Moreover, other features like the deformation-dependent permeability,
	the possibility to include inhomogeneities like varying fibre alignment
	and behaviour, or osmotic effects based on the simplifying assumption
	of Lanir are also included. Finally, the human intervertebral disc
	is chosen as a representative for complex soft biological tissue
	behaviour. In this regard, two numerical examples will be presented
	with focus on the viscoelastic and osmotic capacity of the model.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT We introduce basic ideas of binary separation by a linear
	hyperplane, which is a technique exploited in the support vector
	machine (SVM) concept. This is a decision-making tool for pattern
	recognition and related problems. We describe a fundamental standard
	problem (SP) and show how this is used in most existing research
	to develop a dual-based algorithm for its solution. This algorithm
	is shown to be deficient in certain aspects, and we develop a new
	primal-based SQP-like algorithm, which has some interesting features.
	Most practical SVM problems are not adequately handled by a linear
	hyperplane. We describe the nonlinear SVM technique, which enables
	a nonlinear separating surface to be computed, and we propose a new
	primal algorithm based on the use of low-rank Cholesky factors.It
	may be, however, that exact separation is not desirable due to the
	presence of uncertain or mislabelled data. Dealing with this situation
	is the main challenge in developing suitable algorithms. Existing
	dual-based algorithms use the idea of L1 penalties, which has merit.
	We suggest how penalties can be incorporated into a primal-based
	algorithm. Another aspect of practical SVM problems is often the
	huge size of the data set, which poses severe challenges both for
	software package development and for control of ill-conditioning.
	We illustrate some of these issues with numerical experiments on
	a range of problems.},

	interpolation error typically decreases steadily until some point
	when Runge-type oscillations either halt or reverse this trend. Because
	the most obvious method to calculate an RBF interpolant becomes a
	numerically unstable algorithm for a stable problem in the case of
	near-. at basis functions, there will typically also be a separate
	point at which disastrous ill-conditioning enters. We introduce here
	a new method, RBF-QR, which entirely eliminates such ill-conditioning,
	and we apply it in the special case when the data points are distributed
	over the surface of a sphere. This algorithm works even for thousands
	of node points, and it allows the RBF shape parameter to be optimized
	without the limitations imposed by stability concerns. Since interpolation
	in the. at RBF limit on a sphere is found to coincide with spherical
	harmonics interpolation, new insights are gained as to why the RBF
	approach (with non. at basis functions) often is the more accurate
	of the two methods.}},

	To illustrate the method, we apply it to the interior penalty discontinuous
	Galerkin method, which prompts the derivation of new a posteriori

	use the elliptic reconstruction technique and we deal with the nonconforming

	from noisy learning points in the context of RKHS (Reproducing Kernel
	Hilbert Space). We introduce the Kernel Basis Pursuit algorithm,
	which enables us to build a ℓ1-regularized-multiple-kernel estimator.
	The general idea is to decompose the function to learn on a sparse-optimal
	set of spanning functions. Our implementation relies on the Least
	Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) formulation and
	on the Least Angle Regression (LARS) solver. The computation of the
	full regularization path, through the LARS, will enable us to propose
	new adaptive criteria to find an optimal fitness-regularization compromise.
	Finally, we aim at proposing a fast parameter-free method to estimate
	non-uniform-sampled functions.},

	from a simulation
	
	model. This is the driving force for increased e?orts in Model Order
	Reduction (MOR) for high di-
	
	mensional dynamical systems or partial di?erential equations (PDEs).
	This demand for fast simulation
	
	models is even more critical for parametrized problems. Several snapshot-based

	struction exist for parametrized model order reduction, e.g. Proper
	Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
	
	or Reduced Basis (RB) methods. They require the careful choice of

	in such basis generation procedures. First, we describe an approach
	for training set adaptivity. Second,
	
	we introduce an approach for multiple bases on adaptive parameter

  abstract = {During the last decades, reduced basis (RB) methods have been developed
	to a wide methodology for model reduction of problems that are governed
	by parametrized partial differential equations ($P^2DE$s ). In particular
	equations of elliptic and parabolic type for linear, low polynomial
	or monotonic nonlinearities have been treated successfully by RB
	methods using ?nite element schemes. Due to the characteristic of?ine-online
	decomposition, the reduced models often become suitable for a multi-query
	or real-time setting, where simulation results, such as ?eld-variables
	or output estimates, can be approximated reliably and rapidly for
	varying parameters. In the current study, we address a certain class
	of time-dependent evolution schemes with explicit discretization
	operators that are arbitrarily parameter dependent. We extend the
	RB-methodology to these cases by applying the empirical interpolation
	method to localized discretization operators. The main technical
	ingredients are: (i) generation of a collateral reduced basis modelling
	the effects of the discretization operator under parameter variations
	in the of?ine-phase and (ii) an online simulation scheme based on
	a numerical subgrid and localized evaluations of the evolution operator.
	We formulate an a-posteriori error estimator for quanti?cation of
	the resulting reduced simulation error. Numerical experiments on
	a parametrized convection problem, discretized with a ?nite volume
	scheme, demonstrate the applicability of the model reduction technique.
	We obtain a parametrized reduced model, which enables parameter variation
	with fast simulation response. We quantify the computational gain
	with respect to the non-reduced model and investigate the error convergence.},

	The coverage of these stages is organized in three parts that describe

	I covers the period, 1951â1975, during which the so-called classical
	RSM was developed. This includes a review of basic experimental designs
	for fitting linear response surface models, in addition to a description
	of methods for the determination of optimum operating conditions.
	Part II, which covers the period, 1976â1999, discusses more recent
	modeling techniques in RSM, in addition to a coverage of Taguchi's
	robust parameter design and its response surface alternative approach.
	Part III provides a coverage of further extensions and research directions
	in modern RSM. This includes discussions concerning response surface
	models with random effects, generalized linear models, and graphical
	techniques for comparing response surface designs. Copyright Â© 2010

	studying nonlinear approximation. This was motivated by numerous
	applications. Nonlinear approximation is important in applications
	because of its increased efficiency. Two types of nonlinear approximation
	are employed frequently in applications. Adaptive methods are used
	in PDE solvers. The m-term approximation considered here is used
	in image and signal processing as well as the design of neural networks.
	The basic idea behind nonlinear approximation is that the elements
	used in the approximation do not come from a fixed linear space but
	are allowed to depend on the function being approximated. The fundamental
	question of nonlinear approximation is how to construct good methods
	(algorithms) of nonlinear approximation. In this paper we discuss
	greedy type and thresholding type algorithms.},

	reproduction quality of other methods widely used for bivariate interpolation.
	On the other hand, radial basis functions, which have proven to be
	highly useful for multivariate scattered data interpolation, have
	a severe drawback. They are unable to interpolate large sets in an
	efficient and numerically stable way and maintain a good level of
	reproduction quality at the same time. Both problems have been circumvented
	using radial basis functions to evaluate the nodal function of the
	modified Shepard's method. This approach exploits the flexibility
	of the method and improves its reproduction quality. The proposed

	applications. In this paper, we consider the steady-state Rayleigh-Benard
	convection whose mathematical model is assumed to be unknown, but
	numerical data are available. The aim of the paper is to show that,
	using the obtained ensemble of data, POD can be used to model accurately
	the natural convection. Furthermore, this approach is very efficient
	in the sense that it uses the smallest possible number of parameters,
	and thus, is suited for process control. Particularly, we consider
	two boundary control problems 1.(a) tracking problem, and 2.(b) avoiding
	hot spot in a certain region of the domain.},

  abstract = {In this thesis, the reduced-basis method is applied to nonlinear time-dependent
	convection-diffusion parameterized partial differential equations
	(PDEs). A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) procedure is used
	for the construction of reduced-basis approximation for the field
	variables. In the presence of highly nonlinear terms, conventional
	reduced-basis would be inefficient and no longer superior to classical
	numerical approaches using advanced iterative techniques. To recover
	the computational advantage of the reduced-basis approach, an empirical
	interpolation approximation method is employed to define the coefficient-function
	approximation of the nonlinear terms. Next, the coefficient-function
	approximation is incorporated into the reduced-basis method to obtain
	a reduced-order model of nonlinear time-dependent parameterized convection-diffusion
	PDEs. Two formulations for the reduced-order models are proposed,
	which construct the reduced-basis space for the nonlinear functions
	and residual vector respectively. Finally, an offline-online procedure
	for rapid and inexpensive evaluation of the reduced-order model solutions
	and outputs, as well as associated asymptotic a posterior error estimators
	are developed.
	
	(cont.) The operation count for the online stage depends only on the
	dimension of our reduced-basis approximation space and the dimension
	of our coefficient-function approximation space. The extension of
	the reduced-order model to a system of equations is also explored.},

  abstract = {For general non-linear parametrized partial differential equations

	complexity and cannot be pre-computed. This situation also occurs

	In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to generate reduced-order
	models for large-scale systems derived from PDEs, which may involve
	non-linear terms and nonaffine parametric dependence. The main idea
	is to replace the non-linear and nonaffine terms with a coefficient-function
	approximation consisting of a linear combination of pre-computed
	basis functions with parameter-dependent coefficients. The coefficients
	are determined efficiently by an inexpensive and stable interpolation
	at some pre-computed points. The efficiency and accuracy of this

	Lagrange multipliers associated with the contact conditions. The
	elemental arrays are obtained by using a modified two-field, mixed

  abstract = {We discuss the arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC), which has been subject
	of research in a few recent theoretical papers. Like all polynomial
	chaos expansion techniques, aPC approximates the dependence of simulation
	model output on model parameters by expansion in an orthogonal polynomial
	basis. The aPC generalizes chaos expansion techniques towards arbitrary
	distributions with arbitrary probability measures, which can be either
	discrete, continuous, or discretized continuous and can be specified
	either analytically (as probability density/cumulative distribution
	functions), numerically as histogram or as raw data sets. We show
	that the aPC at finite expansion order only demands the existence
	of a finite number of moments and does not require the complete knowledge
	or even existence of a probability density function. This avoids
	the necessity to assign parametric probability distributions that
	are not sufficiently supported by limited available data. Alternatively,
	it allows modellers to choose freely of technical constraints the
	shapes of their statistical assumptions. Our key idea is to align
	the complexity level and order of analysis with the reliability and
	detail level of statistical information on the input parameters.
	We provide conditions for existence and clarify the relation of the
	aPC to statistical moments of model parameters. We test the performance
	of the aPC with diverse statistical distributions and with raw data.
	In these exemplary test cases, we illustrate the convergence with
	increasing expansion order and, for the first time, with increasing
	reliability level of statistical input information. Our results indicate
	that the aPC shows an exponential convergence rate and converges
	faster than classical polynomial chaos expansion techniques. },

	Sequential
	
	Minimal Optimization, or SMO. Training a support vector machine requires
	the solution of

	breaks this large
	
	QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small
	QP problems are
	
	solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical
	QP optimization as an
	
	inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the
	training set size,
	
	which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because matrix
	computation is
	
	avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the
	training set size for
	
	various test problems, while the standard chunking SVM algorithm scales
	somewhere
	
	between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO’s computation
	time is dominated by
	
	SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data
	sets. On real-
	
	world sparse data sets, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than
	the chunking

  number = {3},
  abstract = {Many of the tools of dynamical systems and control theory have gone
	largely unused for fluids, because the governing equations are so
	dynamically complex, both high-dimensional and nonlinear. Model reduction
	involves finding low-dimensional models that approximate the full
	high-dimensional dynamics. This paper compares three different methods
	of model reduction: proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), balanced
	truncation, and a method called balanced POD. Balanced truncation
	produces better reduced-order models than POD, but is not computationally
	tractable for very large systems. Balanced POD is a tractable method
	for computing approximate balanced truncations, that has computational
	cost similar to POD. The method presented here is a variation of
	existing methods using empirical Gramians, and the main contributions
	of the present paper are a version of the method of snapshots that
	allows one to compute balancing transformations directly, without
	separate reduction of the Gramians; and an output projection method,
	which allows tractable computation even when the number of outputs
	is large. The output projection method requires minimal additional
	computation, and has a priori error bounds that can guide the choice
	of rank of the projection. Connections between POD and balanced truncation
	are also illuminated: in particular, balanced truncation may be viewed
	as POD of a particular dataset, using the observability Gramian as
	an inner product. The three methods are illustrated on a numerical
	example, the linearized flow in a plane channel.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this thesis is to develop numerical methods for optimization,
	control and shape design in computational fluid dynamics, more precisely
	in haemodynamics.
	
	
	The application studied is related with the shape optimization of
	an aorto-coronaric bypass.
	
	
	The optimization process has to keep into account aspects which are
	very different and sometimes conflicting, for this reason the process
	has been organized in more levels dealing with a geometrical scale.
	Moreover we have chosen to use simplified low fidelity models during
	the application of the complex optimization tools and to verify in
	feed-back with higher fidelity models the configurations previously
	obtained. In our case we deal with fluid models based on Stokes and
	Navier-Stokes equations, for lower and higher fidelity approach respectively,
	also in the unsteady formulation.
	
	
	At an outer level of the optimization process, efficient numerical
	methods based on parametrized partial differential equations have
	been developed to get real-time and accurate information concerning
	the preliminary configurations, and to get a sensitivity analysis
	on geometrical quantities of interest and on functionals, related
	with fluid mechanics quantities. This approach is carried out by
	reduced basis methods which let us rebuild approximate solutions
	for parametrized equations by other solutions already computed and
	stored, allowing huge computational savings.
	
	
	At an inner level we have developed local shape optimization methods
	by optimal flow control theory based on adjoint approach. Two different
	approaches have been developed: the former is based on the local
	displacement of each node on the boundary, the latter is based on
	small perturbation theory into a reference domain. This approach
	is more complex but let us avoid mesh reconstruction at each iteration
	and study the problem into a deeper context from a theoretical point
	of view and do a generalization dealing with unsteady flows.},
  annote = {This (reduced basis component of this) thesis focuses on reduced
	basis methods for the incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations,
	with particular emphasis on (i) stable "supremizer-enhanced" velocity
	spaces to ensure discrete div-stability, (ii) adjoint-based treatment
	of pressure and velocity output functionals, and (iii) empirical
	interpolation methods for non-affine/curvilinear geometries. The
	methods are applied to several moderate Reynolds number flow problems,

	of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the

	The data, assumed to be sampled from an underlying manifold, are mapped
	into a single global

	from the symmetries of locally
	
	linear reconstructions, and the actual computation of the embedding

	With slight modifications, the same technique can also handle scenarios
	with coalescing data points for fixed radial basis functions. The

	converge towards certain HermiteâBirkhoff problems. This is an

	outputs of coercive and noncoercive linear elliptic partial differential
	equations with affine parameter dependence. The essential components
	are: (i) rapidly convergent global reduced basis approximations -
	(Galerkin) projection onto a space WN spanned by solutions of the
	governing partial differential equation at N judiciously selected
	points in parameter space; (ii) a posteriori error estimation - relaxations
	of the error-residual equation that provide inexpensive yet sharp
	bounds for the error in the outputs of interest; and (iii) offiine/online
	computational procedures - methods which decouple the generation
	and projection stages of the approximation process. The operation
	count for the online stage - in which, given a new parameter value,
	we calculate the output of interest and associated error bound -
	depends only on N (typically very small) and the parametric complexity
	of the problem.In this paper we propose a new "natural norm" formulation
	for our reduced basis error estimation framework that: (a) greatly
	simplifies and improves our inf-sup lower bound construction (offline)
	and evaluation (online) - a critical ingredient of our a posteriori
	error estimators; and (b) much better controls - significantly sharpens
	- our output error bounds, in particular (through deflation) for
	parameter values corresponding to nearly singular solution behavior.
	We apply the method to two illustrative problems: a coercive Laplacian
	heat conduction problem which becomes singular as the heat transfer
	coefficient tends to zero; and a non-coercive Helmholtz acoustics
	problem - which becomes singular as we approach resonance. In both
	cases, we observe very economical and sharp construction of the requisite
	natural-norm inf-sup lower bound; rapid convergence of the reduced
	basis approximation; reasonable effectivities (even for near-singular
	behavior) for our deflated output error estimators; and significant
	- several order of magnitude - (online) computational savings relative
	to standard finite element procedures.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a wide framework for online, i.e., time-adaptive,
	supervised multiregression tasks. The problem is formulated in a
	general infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).
	In this context, a fairly large number of nonlinear multiregression
	models fall as special cases, including the linear case. Any convex,
	continuous, and not necessarily differentiable function can be used
	as a loss function in order to quantify the disagreement between
	the output of the system and the desired response. The only requirement
	is the subgradient of the adopted loss function to be available in
	an analytic form. To this end, we demonstrate a way to calculate
	the subgradients of robust loss functions, suitable for the multiregression
	task. As it is by now well documented, when dealing with online schemes
	in RKHS, the memory keeps increasing with each iteration step. To
	attack this problem, a simple sparsification strategy is utilized,
	which leads to an algorithmic scheme of linear complexity with respect
	to the number of unknown parameters. A convergence analysis of the
	technique, based on arguments of convex analysis, is also provided.
	To demonstrate the capacity of the proposed method, the multiregressor
	is applied to the multiaccess multiple-input multiple-output channel
	equalization task for a setting with poor resources and nonavailable
	channel information. Numerical results verify the potential of the
	method, when its performance is compared with those of the state-of-the-art
	linear techniques, which, in contrast, use space-time coding, more
	antenna elements, as well as full channel information.},

  abstract = {In this survey we discuss properties of specific methods of approximation
	that belong to a family of greedy approximation methods (greedy algorithms).
	It is now well understood that we need to study nonlinear sparse
	representations in order to significantly increase our ability to
	process (compress, denoise, etc.) large data sets. Sparse representations
	of a function are not only a powerful analytic tool but they are
	utilized in many application areas such as image/signal processing
	and numerical computation. The key to finding sparse representations
	is the concept of m-term approximation of the target function by
	the elements of a given system of functions (dictionary). The fundamental
	question is how to construct good methods (algorithms) of approximation.
	Recent results have established that greedy-type algorithms are suitable
	methods of nonlinear approximation in both m-term approximation with
	regard to bases, and m-term approximation with regard to redundant
	systems. It turns out that there is one fundamental principle that
	allows us to build good algorithms, both for arbitrary redundant
	systems and for very simple well-structured bases, such as the Haar
	basis. This principle is the use of a greedy step in searching for
	a new element to be added to a given m-term approximant.},

  journal = {Foundations of Computational Mathematics},
  year = {2008},

  pages = {33-107},
  abstract = {Our main interest in this paper is nonlinear approximation. The basic
	idea behind nonlinear approximation is that the elements used in
	the approximation do not come from a fixed linear space but are allowed
	to depend on the function being approximated. While the scope of
	this paper is mostly theoretical, we should note that this form of
	approximation appears in many numerical applications such as adaptive
	PDE solvers, compression of images and signals, statistical classification,
	and so on. The standard problem in this regard is the problem of
	m -term approximation where one fixes a basis and looks to approximate
	a target function by a linear combination of m terms of the basis.
	When the basis is a wavelet basis or a basis of other waveforms,
	then this type of approximation is the starting point for compression
	algorithms. We are interested in the quantitative aspects of this
	type of approximation. Namely, we want to understand the properties
	(usually smoothness) of the function which govern its rate of approximation
	in some given norm (or metric). We are also interested in stable
	algorithms for finding good or near best approximations using m terms.
	Some of our earlier work has introduced and analyzed such algorithms.
	More recently, there has emerged another more complicated form of
	nonlinear approximation which we call highly nonlinear approximation.
	It takes many forms but has the basic ingredient that a basis is
	replaced by a larger system of functions that is usually redundant.
	Some types of approximation that fall into this general category
	are mathematical frames, adaptive pursuit (or greedy algorithms),
	and adaptive basis selection. Redundancy on the one hand offers much
	promise for greater efficiency in terms of approximation rate, but
	on the other hand gives rise to highly nontrivial theoretical and
	practical problems. With this motivation, our recent work and the
	current activity focuses on nonlinear approximation both in the classical
	form of m -term approximation (where several important problems remain
	unsolved) and in the form of highly nonlinear approximation where
	a theory is only now emerging.},

  abstract = {We present a technique for the evaluation of linear-functional outputs
	of parametrized elliptic partial differential equations in the context
	of deployed (in service) systems. Deployed systems require real-time
	and certified output prediction in support of immediate and safe
	(feasible) action. The two essential components of our approach are
	(i) rapidly, uniformly convergent reduced-basis approximations, and
	(ii) associated rigorous and sharp a posteriori error bounds; in
	both components we exploit affine parametric structure and offline-online
	computational decompositions to provide real-time deployed response.
	In this paper we extend our methodology to the parametrized steady
	incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
	
	We invoke the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart theory for analysis of variational
	approximations of non-linear partial differential equations to construct
	rigorous, quantitative, sharp, inexpensive a posteriori error estimators.
	The crucial new contribution is offline-online computational procedures
	for calculation of (a) the dual norm of the requisite residuals,
	(b) an upper bound for the L4()-H1() Sobolev embedding continuity
	constant, (c) a lower bound for the Babuka inf-sup stability constant,
	and (d) the adjoint contributions associated with the output. Numerical
	results for natural convection in a cavity confirm the rapid convergence
	of the reduced-basis approximation, the good effectivity of the associated
	a posteriori error bounds in the energy and output norms, and the
	rapid deployed response.},

  abstract = {This book serves well as an introduction into the more theoretical
	aspects of the use of spline models. It develops a theory and practice
	for the estimation of functions from noisy data on functionals. The
	simplest example is the estimation of a smooth curve, given noisy
	observations on a finite number of its values. The estimate is a
	polynomial smoothing spline. By placing this smoothing problem in
	the setting of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, a theory is developed
	which includes univariate smoothing splines, thin plate splines in
	d dimensions, splines on the sphere, additive splines, and interaction
	splines in a single framework. A straightforward generalization allows
	the theory to encompass the very important area of (Tikhonov) regularization
	methods for ill-posed inverse problems.
	
	
	Convergence properties, data based smoothing parameter selection,
	confidence intervals, and numerical methods are established which
	are appropriate to a wide variety of problems which fall within this
	framework. Methods for including side conditions and other prior
	information in solving ill-posed inverse problems are included. Data
	which involves samples of random variables with Gaussian, Poisson,
	binomial, and other distributions are treated in a unified optimization
	context. Experimental design questions, i.e., which functionals should
	be observed, are studied in a general context. Extensions to distributed
	parameter system identification problems are made by considering
	implicitly defined functionals.},

	constant estimation that enables rigorous but efficient a-posteriori
	error estimation. The computation of
	
	the error estimator is realized by solving a small auxiliary ODE system
	during online simulations and estimation iterations can be performed
	that allow a balancing
	
	between estimation sharpness and computation time. Finally, numerical
	experiments demonstrate the rigour of the error bounds.},

  abstract = {A family of classification algorithms generated from Tikhonov regularization
	schemes are considered. They involve multi-kernel spaces and general
	convex loss functions. Our main purpose is to provide satisfactory
	estimates for the excess misclassification error of these multi-kernel
	regularized classifiers when the loss functions achieve the zero
	value. The error analysis consists of two parts: regularization error
	and sample error. Allowing multi-kernels in the algorithm improves
	the regularization error and approximation error, which is one advantage
	of the multi-kernel setting. For a general loss function, we show
	how to bound the regularization error by the approximation in some
	weighted L q spaces. For the sample error, we use a projection operator.
	The projection in connection with the decay of the regularization
	error enables us to improve convergence rates in the literature even
	for the one-kernel schemes and special loss functions: least-square
	loss and hinge loss for support vector machine soft margin classifiers.
	Existence of the optimization problem for the regularization scheme
	associated with multi-kernels is verified when the kernel functions
	are continuous with respect to the index set. Concrete examples,
	including Gaussian kernels with flexible variances and probability
	distributions with some noise conditions, are used to illustrate
	the general theory. },
